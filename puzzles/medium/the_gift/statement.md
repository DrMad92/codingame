The Oods want to offer a present to one of them. The thing is, they all have different budgets to invest in this present. Of course, their unique wish is to find the fairest method that will determine the maximum budget that each Ood can afford. The Oods have been discussing this issue for days, and up until now, they have not managed to find a totally satisfactory solution.

The Doctor decides to give a helping hand by creating a program. His idea is to check if the Oods have enough money to buy the present, and if so, to calculate how much each Ood should pay, according to their respective budget limit.
