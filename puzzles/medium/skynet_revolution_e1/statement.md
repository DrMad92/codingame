# Statement

Your virus has caused a backdoor to open on the Skynet network enabling you to send new instructions in real time.

You decide to take action by stopping Skynet from communicating on its own internal network.

Skynet's network is divided into several smaller networks, in each sub-network is a Skynet agent tasked with transferring information by moving from node to node along links and accessing gateways leading to other sub-networks.

Your mission is to reprogram the virus so it will sever links in such a way that the Skynet Agent is unable to access another sub-network thus preventing information concerning the presence of our virus to reach Skynet's central hub.
